### the _a-third pyramid algorithm_ - to demonstrate that a Pyramid's volume is a third of a corresponding Cube's volume

  ```
  I'm building a pyramid from cubic blocks.
  Let's assume that at the base of the pyramid, on its ground floor, there are 16 blocks forming a square.
  On top of them is placed another layer of blocks, this time it's a square made up of 9 blocks (as if the first floor of the pyramid).
  Higher up is the next floor, composed of 4 blocks and finally at the very top 1 block.
  This is how I built the pyramid.
  It consists of as many blocks as the sum of squares of consecutive numbers from 1 to 4, thus 1+4+9+16=30.

  Next to the pyramid stands a cubic structure made of similar blocks.
  It has a volume of 4 times 4 times 4, that is 4 to the power of 3, which is 64.

  Please write a simple console application that, depending on what integer the user enters, compares the volume of the pyramid and the cube.
  For example, if the user enters the number 5, the application will calculate the volume of the cube as 5 times 5 times 5, and the volume of the pyramid as 1 plus 4 plus 9 plus 16 plus 25.
  The goal: to demonstrate that a Pyramid's volume is a third of a corresponding Cube's volume.
