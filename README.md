### The significance
**Core value**: Persistent, reusable context with clean iteration capabilities
- 🖱️**One-click persistent history**: Requirements and findings readily available without reconstruction
- 🌋**Pollution-free refinement**: Freely adjust prompts and retry without cluttering context
- 📚**Curated, manageable context**: Selective inclusion of valuable insights only; stays compact (~few hundred lines)
- 💫 **Full flexibility**: Query anything (tiny or large), restart from any point, iterate endlessly
- 🏖️ **Seamless VS Code integration**: Easy file attachment and context building

### Demo usage
**Example usage:** Demo built with code from https://github.com/dotnet/eShop.
